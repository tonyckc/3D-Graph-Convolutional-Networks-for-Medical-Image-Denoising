# 3D-Graph-Convolutional-Networks-for-Medical-Image-denoising
This project, i.e.,3D GCN module, is for the paper "3D Graph Convolutional Networks for Slice-based Medical Image denoising.". We will upload this
paper to arxiv.com later.  
# Main idea
You can impose this module to extract the non-local information of  medical image intra-slice with a play-and-plug fashion. Also, this can leverage the 3D spatial information between slices. Finally, those information are aggregated as a hybrid one through a trainable weight.
If you have any questions, please feel free to conduct me (cs.ckc96@gmail.com).
